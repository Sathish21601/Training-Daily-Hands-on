      Snapchat is a mobile app for Android and iOS devices. Colloquially, the
      app is often called Snap by its users. Meanwhile, Snapchatâ€™s developer is
      a public company also called Snap, confusingly. The company itself claims
      to be a camera company. (As such, it creates other products, including
      hardware, like Snapchat Spectacles.) Whichever you choose to call it, Snap
      is headed by co-founder Evan Spiegel.
